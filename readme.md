## Welcome

This repository is a branch by branch walk through of this [Google IO 2021 Workshop](#)

### Getting Started

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is the tool used in this project. Have node.js (v12 or newer) installed and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The command line will show you where to visit the running project, and enjoy live CSS and JS reloading.
